## Introduction:
In this project, children will learn how to use list variables to store data, as well as how simple custom blocks (functions) can be used to simplify their programs.

## Resources
For this project, Scratch 2 should be used. Scratch 2 can either be used online at [jumpto.cc/scratch-on](http://jumpto.cc/scratch-on) or can be downloaded from [jumpto.cc/scratch-off](http://jumpto.cc/scratch-off) and used offline.

You can find a completed version of this project <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/34874510/#editor">online</a>, or it can be downloaded by clicking the 'Project Materials' link for this project, which contains:

+ Memory.sb2

## Learning Objectives
+ Lists;
+ Simple functions.

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum):

+ [Combine programming constructs to solve a problem.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/builder)

## Challenges
+ "Adding sound" - improving the usability of the game;
+ "Creating 4 buttons" - manipulating lists;
+ "Making more blocks" - creating custom blocks;
+ "Another costume" - improving the usability of the game;
+ "Difficulty level" - modifying the data stored in a list.
